# Infinite Scheduler
 This simple scheduler calendar app allows users to easily book appointments for future dates within the current year.  The intuitive calendar interface highlights the current day, disables past dates, and clearly marks available booking slots on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays with a "+" icon.  Users can navigate through future months to select their desired booking date.  The booking process is streamlined, requiring only essential details such as name, phone number, age, and gender, with the option to add information for up to two additional people.  The app prevents duplicate bookings for the same phone number on the same date, ensuring a smooth and organized scheduling experience.  Bookings are stored locally in the browser, making them persistent across sessions.  A dedicated "Current Month Bookings" page provides a convenient overview of all appointments scheduled for the current month.
